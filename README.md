# DAT355_getUsedToEMF

I have followed the tutorial more or less until the "EMF Data Management" section. The only real exception is the "EMF API" part where I found the description unclear and did not quite understand where to actually add the given the methods and use JUnit on it, so I skipped it. I have done task 1-3.

- Task2 folder is the project I created to follow the tutorial.
- runtime-New_configuration folder is where the code generated stuff is.
- exampleSolution2 folder is the workspace with the files from the .zip file that the tutorial told me to download. Haven't changed anything there yet since I stopped at "EMF Data Management".
